# Near-Field EMI Detector

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and develop a near-field electromagnetic interference (EMI) detector capable 
of measuring electric and magnetic fields separately. The detector will use a microcontroller and two 
sensor probes one for detecting electric fields (E-fields) and one for detecting magnetic fields (H-fields). 
By measuring these fields individually, the detector will provide precise data on EMI sources, which is 
valuable for troubleshooting and optimizing electronic circuits.
